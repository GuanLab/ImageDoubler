Weights can be downloaded from this figshare repository: [ImageDoubler pretrained weights](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27606801.v1). It contains two zip files of weights:  
* labeler1_weights.zip: all the weights for the models trained on image data labeled by the first labeler
* labeler2_weights.zip: all the weights for the models trained on image data labeled by the second labeler

```
# to use the labeler-1's models
unzip labeler1_weights.zip
cp -r labeler1_weights/* .
```
